# Acknowledgments

I am grateful to the instructor and my classmates for their thoughtful reviews of my original submission. Their feedback directly shaped this revision in the following ways:

- **Modeling clarity.** I added an explicit bridge aligning the continuous Cournot equilibrium \((20,20)\) with the three discrete equilibria \((10,30),(20,20),(30,10)\) used in GTE/Colab—clarifying that multiplicity is a **discretization choice** for computation/visualization rather than a contradiction.  
- **oTree citation & adaptation.** I formally cited oTree and documented the **single** adaptation: restricting quantity choices to \(\{10,20,30\}\) to mirror the GTE \(3\times3\) strategic form; I also explained the **behavioral/tractability** motivation for this discretization.  
- **Software citations.** I added the required software/model citations (Nashpy, QuantEcon, GTE) and LLM interfaces, including versions where specified.  
- **Figure quality & captions.** I standardized figure numbers and captions, referenced each figure in text, and improved readability for GTE screenshots and solver outputs.  
- **LLM transparency.** I documented prompts, the rotating winner’s-curse reminder treatment, model settings, and the logging schema to clarify framing effects on model behavior.
